# What is data parsing?
Data parsing is a process during which a piece of data gets converted into a different type of data according to specified criteria. It’s an important part of web scraping since it helps transform raw HTML data into a more easily readable format that can be understood and analyzed.

## What does a parser do?
A well-built parser will identify the needed HTML string and the relevant information within it. Based on predefined criteria and the rules of the parser, it’ll filter and combine the needed information into CSV, JSON, or any other format.


### What is Beautiful Soup?
Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed web pages based on specific criteria that can be used to extract, navigate, search, and modify data from HTML, which is mostly used for web scraping. Beautiful Soup 4 is supported on Python versions 3.6 and greater. Being a useful library, it can save programmers loads of time when collecting data and parsing it.
